# Starter Workflows (Organization Templated Workflows)

- Starter workflows are templates that you can create to allow anyone to do it more quickly and easily by having a template to start with
- They provide a starting place for workflows that your teams typically use, and they can just modify them for their particular projects
- The templates you create don't become part of the marketplace for anyone on GitHub
- Starter workflows need to be stored in a special repository named .github in a folder called workflow-templates

- Starter workflows created by users can only be used to create workflows in public repositories
- Organizations using GitHub enterprise cloud can also use starter workflows to create workflows in private repositories

- File with the same name as the starter workflow, but with appended .properties.json provides some metadata about the starter workflow
